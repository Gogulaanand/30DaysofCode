</ul>
<h4>Day5:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Continued with the functional programming section in freecodecamp</li>
  <li>learnt about the principles, and ethics to follow for a neat code and also the advantages of following the principles of functional programming it by spending quite some time debugging a code that didnt follow the same. Phew!! :)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Day6:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Learnt about filter, map and reduce functions a bit more and applied the same to arrays and prototypes</li>
</ul>
<h4>Day7:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Learnt about slice, every, some, sort, concat functions and applied the same to arrays and prototypes</li>
  <li>Completed the intro computer vision section in udacity's computer vision nanodegree</li> 
</ul>
<h4>Day8:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Completed functional programming challenges in freecodecamp</li>
  <li>Started the "Image representation and classification" lesson in computer vision Nanodegree. learnt about cv2 library and some of its its basic functions, pixel representation of images, manipulating pixels to produce desired image(aka processing :)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Day9:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Started intermediate algorithm scripting in java script by freecodecamp</li>
  <li>learnt to use cv2 library to isolate objects in images using pixel threshold values and combine separate images into one</li>
</ul>
<h4>Day10:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>continued with intermediate algorithm scripting in java script by freecodecamp</li>
  <li>learnt to use hsv to identify and isolate objects even in varying lighting conditions based on color thresholds </li>
</ul>
<h4>Day11:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>learnt about feature extraction in images and image preprocessing methods. Working on a day and night image classifier</li>
  <li>completed intermediate algorithm scripting in Javascript by freecodecamp</li>
</ul>
<h4>Day12:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>completed the day night image classifier in the CV nanodegree by udacity</li>
  <li>learnt about filters, frequency in images</li>
</ul>

  <li>Built user data model to handle microposts using scaffold generator in rails. Learnt about the REST architecture</li>
</ul>
<h4>Day14 (late update):</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Built the microposts model and linked the user resource and the micropost resource. Learnt about the disadvantages of scaffold generated code and the usefulness of the rest architecture while developing RoR applications like the identical code structure</li>
</ul>
<h4>Day15 (late update):</h4>
  <li>Learnt about:
  <ul>
    <li>1. fourier transform on images</li>
    <li>2. representation of images in frequency domain</li>
    <li>3. high pass and low pass filters, gradients, filters/kernels, sobel filter and edge detection (horizontal and vertical)</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Day16 :</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Learnt about canny edge detector, hough transform of images, haar cascade filters, and used a harr cascade classifier to identify faces in an image containing multiple peoples</li>
</ul>
